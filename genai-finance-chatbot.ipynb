It uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user queries. Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular in the finance domain due to their ability to provide quick and accurate responses to customer inquiries, reducing the need for human intervention.\n\nIn the finance domain, chatbots are used for various purposes, such as:\n\n1. Customer Service: Chatbots can provide quick and accurate responses to customer inquiries, such as account balances, transaction history, and bill payments. This reduces the workload on customer service representatives and provides a better customer experience.\n\n2. Financial Advice: Chatbots can provide personalized financial advice based on a user's financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment history. This can help users make informed investment decisions and manage their finances more effectively.\n\n3. Fraud Detection: Chatbots can analyze transaction data in real-time and detect any suspicious activity, such as unusual spending patterns or unauthorized access. This can help prevent fraud and protect user accounts.\n\n4.

It uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user queries. Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular in the finance domain due to their ability to provide quick and accurate responses to customer inquiries, reducing the need for human intervention.\n\nIn the finance domain, chatbots are used for various purposes, such as:\n\n1. Customer Service: Chatbots can provide quick and accurate responses to customer inquiries, such as account balances, transaction history, and bill payments. This reduces the workload on customer service representatives and provides a better customer experience.\n\n2. Financial Advice: Chatbots can provide personalized financial advice based on a user's financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment history. This can help users make informed investment decisions and manage their finances more effectively.\n\n3. Fraud Detection: Chatbots can analyze transaction data in real-time and detect any suspicious activity, such as unusual spending patterns or unauthorized access. This can help prevent fraud and protect user accounts.\n\n4. Personal Finance Management: Chatbots can help users manage their personal finances by providing budgeting advice, tracking expenses, and suggesting ways to save money. This can help users achieve their financial goals and improve their overall financial health.\n\nIn summary, chatbots are a powerful tool in the finance domain, providing quick and accurate responses, personalized financial advice, fraud detection, and personal finance management. As AI and NLP technologies continue to advance, chatbots will become even more sophisticated and provide even more value to users in the finance domain."},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\nfrom langchain_community.llms import HuggingFaceHub\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\nimport os\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\nos.environ[\"HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN\"] = \"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\"\n\n# Define the prompt template\ntemplate = \"\"\"\nYou are a Finance QNA Expert, Analyze the Query and Respond to Customer with suitable answer.
